# The Nuances of Humor Across America and Europe

## Part 1 : Introduction

## Part 2 : Presentation

In our database, we noticed that the "Genres" column contained many descriptions that were not particularly relevant to our subject, such as "World Cinema," "Short Film," or "Indie." These categories did not provide meaningful information about the type of comedy, making the analysis more confusing. As enthusiasts of humorous films, we decided to restructure this classification to create our own subcategories, allowing for a deeper exploration of the different types of comedies available.

To achieve this, we developed a dictionary that groups specific keywords associated with various comedy subgenres. These keywords enable us to automatically reorganize and identify films into categories such as "Comedy_Romance," "Comedy_Action," "Comedy_Animation," and many others. For instance, films containing words like "romantic" or "romance" are categorized under "Comedy_Romance," while those with terms like "animated" or "anime" are classified under "Comedy_Animation."

        Comparing American to European humor is like contrasting a burger that looks perfect in an ad with a subtly crafted gourmet dish. American jokes hit you with all the flash of a well-marketed blockbuster, designed to grab your attention immediately. Meanwhile, European humor is more like a delicately seasoned meal that reveals its depth over time. Perhaps one day, we‚Äôll blend these styles to cook up the ultimate comedic dish! But let's not forget, the burger is just as delicious.

      <p>Looking at the average nominations for comedy films by continent, we find that Europe leads with the finesse of a gourmet dish, accumulating nominations like a chef garners Michelin stars. On the other hand, America, with its fast-food style cinema, snags fewer nods. Perhaps the European secret lies in their subtle, critical recipe, effective in charming juries. Meanwhile, America serves its comedies like burgers: quick and tasty, but less likely to win stars. Maybe a dash of refinement in American comedies could spice up this culinary competition between continents! In the end, it seems Americans might be doing just like us with this job: they throw in 3D graphs to look pretty with the help of their super powerful computers, but ultimately? Well, too lazy to dive into the math, but yes, it‚Äôs a Mann-Whitney U test that confirms Europeans get nominated more often. All that for this!</p>

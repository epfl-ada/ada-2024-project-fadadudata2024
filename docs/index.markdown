This project tackles global humor like a foodie facing an all-you-can-eat dessert buffet: on one side, American comedy‚Äîgenerous with gags and explosions; on the other, European laughter‚Äîsometimes as refined as a delicate pastry, sometimes as bold as a strong espresso. By exploring the CMU Movie Summary Corpus and OMDB data, we‚Äôll dive into storylines, the variety of actors, box-office success, and rich critiques. Our mission? To understand what makes audiences laugh out loud from one continent to another. By telling this story, we hope to highlight the rich diversity of humor around the world and show how laughter can be universal, yet shaped by specific cultural factors. ü§π‚Äç‚ôÄüç∞

            The <strong>CMU Movie Summary Corpus</strong>, our trusty stick üç≠, holds the essential ingredients for our cinematic cotton candy: plot summaries, genres, countries, and languages of movies. To make it even tastier, we sprinkled it with sweet data from the <strong>OMDB API</strong> üç¨, adding flavors like <strong>ratings</strong> (IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Metascore), <strong>posters</strong>, <strong>age classifications (Rated)</strong>, and <strong>awards</strong>. Some of these layers even needed a little "reshaping" to avoid getting too sticky!
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, with the help of the <strong>CoreNLP pipeline</strong>, we spun the plot summaries like a real cotton candy machine, pulling linguistic threads to enrich our analysis. That said, some layers, like actor metadata (gender, age...) and other CMU treats, were left aside‚Äîlike leftover sugar at the bottom of the vat üçØ.

      <p style="text-align: justify;">In our database, the "Genres" column was like a chaotic junk drawer full of random labels such as "World Cinema," "Short Film," or "Indie." üóÇÔ∏è These were about as useful as a punchline without a joke ‚Äì confusing and totally unhelpful for analyzing comedy! ü§î</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">So, as true comedy enthusiasts, we rolled up our sleeves (and flexed our funny bones) to bring some order to the madness. Instead of trying to decode this mess, we decided to create our own subcategories to dive deeper into the delightful world of different types of comedy.üé¨</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">To make it happen, we developed a magical dictionary ü™Ñüìñ (sadly, it doesn‚Äôt talk‚Ä¶ yet) that groups specific keywords linked to various comedy subgenres. With this genius tool, we can now automatically sort films into categories like "Comedy_Romance," "Comedy_Action," "Comedy_Animation," and many more. </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">For example, any film that dares to drop words like "romantic" or "romance" gets whisked straight into "Comedy_Romance." üíò Meanwhile, those whispering terms like "animated" or "anime" are promptly filed under "Comedy_Animation." ü§™ In short, we‚Äôve turned a big ol‚Äô mess into a well-organized laugh factory.

      This carousel is not just a collection of definitions but a roadmap for tackling complex data questions systematically and effectively.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">The carousel introduces statistical concepts tailored for different aspects of analysis. The KS Test helps determine whether a dataset follows a specific distribution, such as the normal distribution. The Independent T-Test compares the means of two independent groups to assess whether the differences are statistically significant or due to random variation. For data that doesn‚Äôt meet the assumption of normality, the Mann-Whitney U Test offers a non-parametric alternative by comparing distributions between two independent groups. Lastly, Confidence Intervals go beyond hypothesis testing, providing an estimated range where the true population parameter is likely to fall, helping quantify the reliability and precision of your estimates.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Each section of the carousel follows a consistent structure, making it easier to understand and apply the concepts. It provides an explanation, defines the hypotheses, lists the assumptions, guides interpretation of the results, and includes the mathematical formula for deeper exploration.</p>

## The rating of the comedies : critics vs users

<div class="container-fluid">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-6">
    <p style="text-align: justify;">To better analyze comedies and understand humor from different perspectives, we categorized ratings into three main groups of viewers: general spectators, professional critics, and evaluation experts. Each group offers a unique perspective, allowing us to explore differences in humor appreciation based on their roles and experiences.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">- <strong>The Spectators</strong>: Represented by public ratings on IMDb, these reviews reflect a broad and popular perception of humor, offering direct insights from the general audience.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">- <strong>The Critics' Panel</strong>: Ratings from Rotten Tomatoes (Tomatometer) aggregate opinions from professional critics. These bring a more technical and structured analysis of humorous content.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">- <strong>The Evaluation Experts</strong>: Aggregated scores from Metacritic provide another professional perspective, combining various critical viewpoints to form a balanced and synthesized evaluation.</p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">Ladies and gentlemen, step right up to witness a thrilling performance in the world of ratings! üé≠‚ú®</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">On our grand stage, we present the battle of opinions between <strong>critics</strong> and <strong>users</strong>, spanning two continents: <strong>Europe</strong> and <strong>America</strong>. The spotlight is on whether critics are harsher judges than their user counterparts. Let's dive into the show!</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"> As we delve deeper into the world of ratings, one key revelation stands out: the distributions of ratings are not normal. This critical insight steers us toward the Mann-Whitney U Test, our trusted judge for non-parametric data. üé©‚ú® </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"> 
      Unlike tests that rely on assumptions of normality, the Mann-Whitney U Test is perfectly suited for the unique patterns in our data. It evaluates whether there is a significant difference between two independent groups‚Äîin this case, critics and users, for both European and American films.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>




#### **Act 1: European Films** üé¨üá™üá∫
In the European corner, we see harmony in the ring. The **Mann-Whitney U test** shows no significant difference between critics and users. The p-value, a respectable **9.99e-1**, whispers, "All is well!" Critics and users seem to share a common appreciation for European films, leaving no drama behind the scenes. It‚Äôs a peaceful performance where everyone applauds in unison! üëè

#### **Act 2: American Films** üé¨üá∫üá∏
Now, for the dramatic twist! The American films take center stage with a fiery p-value of **6.65e-192**, screaming, "Conflict ahead!" Critics are revealed to be the stricter judges, casting their votes with a harsher tone compared to the generous ratings of users. This significant difference sparks an intense debate, as critics lower the curtain on American films more harshly than users. üéüÔ∏è

#### **The Grand Finale** üåü
Our spectacular show reveals contrasting stories. While Europe enjoys a harmonious duet between critics and users, America witnesses a tug-of-war on the tightrope of ratings. Could it be cultural differences, distinct cinematic tastes, or simply a clash of perspectives? üé≠ Only the audience can decide as the circus continues its journey of exploration.

Stay tuned for more dazzling data insights, and don‚Äôt forget to grab your popcorn for the next act! üçø‚ú®




## Are European comedies judged better than American comedies

<div class="container-fluid">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-4">
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Step into the ring where critics and users cast their votes, and the ratings reveal a fascinating tale of cinematic perception across continents. European films steal the show with higher average ratings across all sources‚ÄîIMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic. The bars for Europe stand taller, their confidence intervals tightly grouped, signaling consistent appreciation. Whether it's users on IMDb or critics from Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic, the verdict is clear: European films resonate more with audiences and critics alike. A standing ovation for Europe! üëè</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">American films, on the other hand, face a tougher crowd. While their IMDb ratings are close to those of European films, the Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic ratings tell a different story. Critics seem to hold American films to a stricter standard, with their ratings notably lower. The confidence intervals here suggest some variability, but the overall message remains consistent‚Äîcritics are harsher on American productions. A dramatic twist! üéüÔ∏è</p>

        Comparing American to European humor is like contrasting a burger that looks perfect in an ad with a subtly crafted gourmet dish. American jokes hit you with all the flash of a well-marketed blockbuster, designed to grab your attention immediately. Meanwhile, European humor reveals its depth over time. Perhaps one day, we‚Äôll blend these styles to cook up the ultimate comedic dish! But let's not forget, someone might take a burger, where someone else would take¬†a¬†fancy¬†dish ! But let's not forget, the burger is just as¬†delicious¬†üî•.

Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, get ready because in this next act we tackle the dazzling, high-flying question: How does Ethnic diversity influence the rating of¬†a¬†Comedy? Let‚Äôs take a peek under the Big Top and reveal tonight‚Äôs program:

- Taming the Wild Freebase IDs into Recognizable Ethnicities
- Juggling 353 Ethnicities into 8 Manageable Hyperclasses
- Assembling the Cast for All Movies in Our Dataset
- Calculating the Diversity Score with Death-Defying Precision

## Taming the Wild Freebase IDs into Recognizable Ethnicities üêÖ

Our first act features a mapping of IDs to Ethnicity names, the data lion tamer extraordinaire! It wrangled those cryptic `freebase_id`'s into recognizable ethnicities. No more staring at an undecipherable wall of IDs, now we‚Äôve got proper names like ‚ÄúIrish‚Äù or ‚ÄúTamil,‚Äù making it much easier to work with. 

With this transformation, Actor_Ethnicity has gone from being the clown car of ambiguity to a streamlined parade of clarity. Cue the applause! üëè

## Juggling 353 Ethnicities into 8 Manageable Hyperclasses ü§π‚Äç‚ôÄ

Now behold the grand juggling act! Imagine trying to juggle 353 flaming torches-chaos, right? That‚Äôs what it feels like handling all the different ethnicities in our dataset. To tame this wild pachyderm of data, we sorted them into 8 mighty hyperclasses:

- African Descent or African
- European Descent and European
- Jewish
- Asian Descent or Asian
- Middle Eastern Descent or Middle Eastern
- Latin Descent or Latin
- Indigenous
- Other

With this, the crowd can now follow the show without getting lost in a sea of details. Instead of an unwieldy stampede, we‚Äôve got a neat parade of 8 categories marching in perfect harmony!


## Assembling the Cast for All Movies in Our Dataset ü¶Åüêí

Now, under the casting tent, we assemble the troupe! Imagine lining up lions, acrobats, and clowns for every movie‚Äôs performance. Our job is to tally up the ethnic composition of each cast, giving us a clear picture of the diversity. Every performer has their role, like every actor has their ethnicity.


## Calculating the Diversity Score with Death-Defying Precision üé¢ü¶ú

Hold your breath, folks‚Äîit‚Äôs time for the grand finale! On a high wire of mathematics, we calculate the diversity score, a value between **0 and 1 that tells us how mixed the cast is:

H(X) = - ‚àë p(x) √ó log‚Çà(p(x)), pour x ‚àà X.

Ici :
p(x) repr√©sente la proportion de chaque hyperclasse dans l'ensemble X.

- Diversity = 0: A one-lion act‚Äîpredictable and dull.
- Diversity = 1: A dazzling menagerie of performers‚Äîbalanced and mesmerizing!

The diversity score captures the randomness, or entropy, of the cast‚Äôs ethnic composition. A high score? A cast as colorful as a ringmaster‚Äôs coat. A low score? A show as predictable as a sad clown act.

Let‚Äôs interpret these magnificent plots, where data performs on the tightrope of IMDb ratings and Ethnicity Scores!

### America: The Lion's Den ü¶Å
In the first plot, the Ethnicity Score shows us the distribution of diversity in American films. The deep red contour at the center is like a lion circling the ring. It represents where most of the data resides. Most American films seem to hover around Ethnicity Score ~0.4 and an IMDb rating of ~6.

Above it all, the dashed red line‚Äîthe Mean Line balances at 0.39, representing the average Ethnicity Score across all American films. 

The lighter contours show the rest of the jungle, where fewer films dare to wander. High diversity (Ethnicity Score close to 1) is a rare sight, like spotting an albino tiger in the wild!


### Europe: The Elephant Parade üêò
In the second plot, we enter the European ring. Here, the Ethnicity Score marches like an elephant in a parade, solid, dependable, and mostly grounded around Ethnicity Score ~0.33 and IMDb rating ~6.

The cool blue contours indicated that European films are slightly less diverse on average. The mean dashed blue line takes a stroll at 0.33, the average Ethnic Diversity Score.

What‚Äôs striking here is the tighter distribution. Europeans seem to play it safe, keeping diversity steady, much like a disciplined elephant troupe.


### The Key Comparison üé≠
- America‚Äôs cast diversity (mean 0.39) is slightly higher than Europe‚Äôs (mean 0.33), suggesting more colorful casting choices in American Comedies. However, we observe that diversity is not necessarily tied to a better rating. Indeed, there is no visible shift in the IMDb ratings as the diversity of a movie‚Äôs cast increases, in America and in Europe.

- The Ethnicity Score spread in America‚Äôs plot shows a more diverse representation of society through Comedies. This most probably stems from the Americas being a land of welcome over the years and fostering a multicultural society.

      <span class="display-1 abang" style="color: white;">Semantic analysis</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


Now let‚Äôs try to analyze the semantic aspect of our comedies. Let‚Äôs first examine the most frequently occurring nouns in movie plots from each continent. The wordclouds below offer a visual representation of these prominent terms, giving us an idea of what are the most used words in plots for each continent.



<div class="container-fluid mt-2 mb-2">
  <div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-6 rounded shadow-sm">
      <img src="{{ '/assets/img/wordclouds/America__None__NN__1.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="General word cloud" class="img-fluid">

    </div>
  </div>
</div>


## Shared Themes Across Continents
Both wordclouds highlight a universal focus on family, love, and life‚Äîtimeless themes that resonate with audiences around the globe. Despite regional differences, the heart of cinema in both Europe and America seems to rest on human connections and relationships.
But these wordclouds are just the beginning. While the themes may appear similar, do they deliver the same kind of humor? ü§î To dig deeper, we used singular value decomposition (SVD), a dimensionality reduction technique, to analyze movie plots and uncover the underlying topics. This approach helps us see what truly defines narratives in each continent and where they align‚Äîor diverge‚Äîon a thematic level.
Take a look at the figure below to explore the two main topics we identified for each continent:

    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<br><br>
### Topic 1: Relationships & Family
<div class="row justify-content-center flex-row-reverse">
  <div class="col-md-6 text-container d-flex align-items-center">
<div>
    <p>
        Relationships and family are the universal glue holding comedy stories together in both 
        American and European films. Words like <strong>life, love, family, friend,</strong> 
        and <strong>man</strong> stood out in our wordclouds, showing these themes never go out of style. 
        Whether it‚Äôs romantic misadventures, family dramas, or those awkward coming-of-age moments, 
        both continents clearly value stories that connect on a personal level. Turns out, we all enjoy 
        a good laugh (or cry) about life‚Äôs little quirks. <span>‚ù§</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Topic 1</strong> clearly transcends cultural boundaries, showing how both regions use films 
        to explore universal emotions and relationships. But let‚Äôs take a closer look‚Äîdo these shared themes 
        really capture the same ideas in the same way on both sides of the Atlantic? <span>ü§î</span>

### Topic 2: Cartoon (America) vs. War & Conflict (Europe)

The second most represented topics diverges sharply between the two regions:

  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6 text-container d-flex align-items-center">
<div>
    <strong>American Films</strong>
    <p>
        Animated slapstick comedies take center stage here, with classics like 
        <em>Tom and Jerry</em> leading the charge. These cartoons rely on 
        physical, exaggerated action to deliver humor‚Äîthink wild chases, flying 
        anvils, and characters bouncing back from impossible falls like it‚Äôs no big deal. 
        <span>üê±üê≠üí•</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Keywords like <strong>tom, jerry, dog, cat,</strong> and 
        <strong>chase</strong> highlight the light-hearted, family-friendly appeal 
        of these animations, making them a global favorite. This trend might reflect 
        America‚Äôs knack for creating humor that offers pure escapism‚Äîsimple, 
        universally relatable, and guaranteed to make you laugh without a single word needed.

    <p><strong>Example film:</strong> <em>Tom and Jerry: The Movie</em> (1992)</p>

</div>


<div class="row justify-content-center flex-row-reverse" style="flex-direction: row-reverse;">
  <div class="col-md-6 text-container d-flex align-items-center">
<div>
    <strong>European Films</strong>
    <p>
        European comedies often lean into historical narratives and intellectual satire, 
        blending humor with thought-provoking themes. Set against the backdrop of war 
        and conflict, these stories use comedy as a lens to explore deeper societal reflections. 
        Keywords like <strong>war, soldier, nazi,</strong> and <strong>village</strong> 
        point to a style of humor rooted in history and cultural critique.
    </p>
    <p>
        This approach tends to have a darker, more cerebral tone, reflecting Europe‚Äôs 
        storytelling tradition‚Äîone that isn‚Äôt afraid to mix laughter with introspection, 
        showing how humor can emerge even in the face of life‚Äôs complexities.

### Comparison

‚Ä¢	American Films: Often tackle these themes with light-hearted comedies, feel-good stories, or hero-driven narratives that inspire and entertain. üé¨‚ú®
‚Ä¢	European Films: Take a more nuanced, introspective approach, weaving in social or historical commentary for added depth and reflection. üé≠üìú

<br>

### Conclusion

‚Ä¢	America leans toward escapism and visual comedy, delivering humor that entertains with light-hearted antics and universally accessible storytelling‚Äîbecause who doesn‚Äôt love a good pie in the face? üé•üçø
‚Ä¢	Europe‚Äôs humor, on the other hand, often dives into life‚Äôs heavier moments, blending satire with historical and social commentary. Shaped by deep historical scars, especially the aftermath of World War II, European storytelling turns humor into a coping tool‚Äîbecause sometimes, you‚Äôve just got to laugh to keep from crying. üé≠üíî

Step right up, ladies and gentlemen, to the great comedy showdown of the continents! üé™ On my left, the United States, a land of comedies filled with visual humor, absurd situations, and accessible jokes that appeal to wide audiences. üê∂üê± On my right, Europe, home to more adult comedies, Rated 16+, where humor often comes with satire, historical reflections, or deep social critiques. üé≠‚ú®
But here‚Äôs the twist: we might have expected American films to dominate the Rated 13+ category... yet that‚Äôs not the case! Both continents seem to share a focus on broad, accessible humor aimed at families or younger audiences. The real difference emerges in the Rated 16+ category.
In this space, Europe clearly stands out. European comedies dive into darker, more subtle, or intellectual themes, often requiring more life experience or reflection to fully appreciate.
But let‚Äôs not forget, this is just a trend! üßÇ IMDb ratings can be subjective, influenced by different types of viewers, and should be taken with a grain of salt. Still, one thing is evident: European comedies tend to be more appreciated overall.
So, which ticket will you choose? The universal, accessible humor of the United States or Europe‚Äôs more refined and thought-provoking style? Either way, laughs are guaranteed... but the data suggests Europe often wins the audience‚Äôs favor. ‚ù§Ô∏è
And just below, you‚Äôll find a plot breaking down the different sub-genres of comedy to confirm these observations, with data to back it up! üìäüé•"

    <span class="display-1 abang">Conclusion</span>
  </div>
</div>

After juggling data, performing analytical pirouettes, and executing a few statistical acrobatics, one thing is clear: humor knows no borders‚Ä¶ or almost! Its forms and expressions are profoundly influenced by cultural contexts. American comedies, often associated with widespread media coverage and box-office success, captivate audiences with their accessibility and ability to appeal to all ages, particularly in the "Rated 13+" categories. In many ways, American films are loved for their slapstick and "cartoon-like" spirit, relying on visual gags and straightforward humor.  

European comedies, on the other hand, focus on narratives rooted in more nuanced themes, often tied to social criticism or historical events. This introspective approach, coupled with a greater prevalence of "Rated 16+" films, reflects an audience drawn to stories blending humor with reflection. These comedies are shaped, in part, by deep historical scars, particularly the consequences of the Second World War.  

While the two continents adopt different approaches, they continue to share universal themes such as love, family, and human relationships, which transcend borders and resonate with all audiences.  

As for ethnic diversity, it remains surprisingly underrepresented in current comedies on both continents. However, this could evolve in the coming years, reflecting societal changes.

In Europe, this diversity is sometimes less visible, reflecting a more conservative cultural context, while in the United States, ethnic diversity is significantly more apparent. It reflects the American melting pot ideal, embracing the multiculturalism that defines the nation's identity..
